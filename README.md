# Crime Records Search Engine
## About 
<b>Crime Records Search Engine</b> is a web application that consumes API from law enforcement agencies such as Interpol and FBI.
In the Initial plan it suppose to get data from PNP and NBI as well but unfortunately, there's no available API from the 2 agency.

I came up with this idea while I was watching a TV Series <b>The Blacklist</b>, There was a scene where an FBI agent is searching records of a person and It shows on a CGI computer screen that the fictional system is searching records from different agency such as <b>CIA, NSA</b> and <b>FBI</b>.

So I thought, What if we have a system like that, Accessible publicly where people can look up someone (New neighbor, tenant, employee, potential lover or a person you just met) if they have a criminal record.
